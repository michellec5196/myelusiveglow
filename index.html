              <p class="testimonials-p">"Just went here for the first time a few weeks ago and got a classic plus set done by Sofia and I love them!! She was professional and did a great job I'll definitely be back to see her again for future fills"</p>
              <p class="testimonials-p">"Went to get eyebrow & upper lip wax & a european facial with sofia! Such great service, she's very professional and talks everything through with you before and during the process. The wax was the most painless i've ever had & the facial was very calming & left my skin feeling great! The location is also super clean so you feel at ease during these times. Can't wait to go back."</p>
              <p class="testimonials-p">You cannot go wrong with getting lashes done by Sofia! She is very professional and super sweet. I am so happy I came across her! I tend to be very picky with choosing who I go to to get lash extensions and my experience with the lash tech I went to before was not the best. However, I love the way Sofia does the style and how she talks you through the process as she does it so you know what is going on! I cannot recommend her enough!!! I am so excited for my next appointment with her get my lash fill!"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="review-grid">
              <p class="testimonials-p">"This is my second time getting my lashes done with Sofia! She is so great. She provides many services such as waxing, lashes, and facials! The first time I came here was to pamper myself and have a little self care type of day and let me tell you ladies, I got what I came for!! I got waxed, a European facial, and a classic plus lash set by Sofia! She walked me through every step through out each service! She's super professional, funny, and sweet! The second time, I came in for my two week fill and the picture below is how it came out! BEAUTIFUL! This place is also very clean and cute! Sofia is my new lash tech, y'all should go to her  her social media is @thefairylashtech on ig go look at her work! Along with the cute studio @belleame.beautystudio"</p>
              <p class="testimonials-p">"Sofia is the best! She is super sweet and very passionate about her work. I got a classic plus and loved it very much! Look her up on Instagram @thefairylashtech her work is beautiful. Definitely recommend her!"</p>
              <p class="testimonials-p">"If you want your lashes slaying every time! Shoot make an appointment with Sofia! She always does an amazing job, puts pride in what she does and always goes in with 100% confidence. I had been looking for a lash tech to stick with, but always just jumping around. Now I can finally say I have one and I'm not going anywhere. She's educated in all the service she provides. She just doesn't do lashes she does, facials, waxing, and more. She always has a great attitude and you can tell she loves what she does."</p>

              <p class="testimonials-p">"Today i had a lash full set done by Sofia and she was AMAZING. She was extremely attentive to all of my questions and always made sure i was comfortable! She makes you feel like you've been friends for years and when you're done you're blown away by her astonishing work! I already have more appointments scheduled with her! She takes your vision and makes it a reality!"</p>
              <p class="testimonials-p">"I had a great experience with Sofia. She was very kind talking me through the whole process cause I was very nervous. My lashes looked so great and still do. I cant wait to start getting this done regularly with her."</p>
